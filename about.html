        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Yuwei Yang, and I am a student in Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. Before that, I acquired a Masters Degree in industrial design. In these programs, I learnt more skills such as basic software skills (Photoshop, Illustrator, 3DMAXâ€¦), design thinking and communication skills such as efficient work and solving problems in a team. In addition to doing assignments with skills, I also participated in an international design competition with my tutor and classmates as a group and obtained Bronze Awards. I really like designs because I have a lot of passion for it, especially in application to interface and logo designs. I would also like to contribute to developing an application</p>
